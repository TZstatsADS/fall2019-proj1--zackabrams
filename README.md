## Project 1: A "data story" on the songs of our times

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Project title: Is every country song the same?
+ This project is conducted by Zack Abrams

+ Project summary: I grew up on Long Island, an hour east of here. My parents grew up on Long Island too, and although they love folk singers from their youth like Neil Young and Bob Dylan, none of us have ever cared for the country music you'd hear on the radio nowadays. In my view, it's because country songs are all about one of three things: livin' right, drinking after a breakup, or unrequited love. And that repetition gets boring!

However, we're all data scientists, and I know that letting an assumption like this stand without evidence would be a mistake. So, I set out to determine whether the sentiments in country music *are* actually the same more of the time than for other genres.
